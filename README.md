## Assignment

This assignment had the focus on HTML and CSS/SASS. We were given photos, a brief, text and a design for desktop and had our own freedom to redesign it into a tablet- and mobile-version. It was examinated on the ability to utilize semantic HTML effectively, validate HTML and CSS for code accuracy, implement accessibility features for all users, demonstrate proficiency in basic CSS and Sass, strategize and execute design plans with user experience in mind, employ various layout techniques, ensure responsiveness across devices, optimize images for accessibility and SEO, improve site navigation with internal links, enhance visual appeal with text effects and special fonts, incorporate icons for communication, manage layout positioning, utilize cookies for storing user preferences, develop and manage forms, and maintain consistent styling conventions for code readability.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me a lot about SASS and CSS. It also brought my attention to and improved my skills in SEO strategies and accessibility within HTML. I learned how to enhance the clarity of my code and to use the correct semantics when setting up an HTML document. Additionally, I gained an understanding of the importance of fast-loading images and well-structured styling code to minimize code repetition. These are all valuable lessons that I will carry forward from this project.
